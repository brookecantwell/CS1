I have a number between -20 and 20.
Can you guess my number? (y/n) y
Please enter your first guess: 0
Too high. Please guess again: -5
Too high. Please guess again: -10
Too high. Please guess again: -15
Too low. Please guess again: -13
Too high. Please guess again: -14
I guess 6 tries is pretty good.

Would you like to play again? (y/n) n
