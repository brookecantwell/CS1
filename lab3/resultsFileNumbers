 *
 * Prompts the user for three numbers, calculates
 * the sum and the average and determines the
 * largest and smallest numbers. The user is then
 * quizzed on the answers to the sum, average,
 * largest, and smallest. The score (number of
 * questions correctly answer) is then displayed
 * along with a message depending on the score.
